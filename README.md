#Machine Learning
This repository contains Python files implementing various Machine Learning models for both regression and classification tasks. Each model is designed to handle specific types of predictive analytics tasks, leveraging different algorithms tailored to the nature of the problem.

Implemented Models:

Linear Regression:
Used for regression tasks.
Simple and effective for linear relationships in data.

Random Forest:
Effective for both regression and classification tasks.
Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees.

Decision Tree:
Primarily used for classification tasks.
Simple tree-like structure for decision making.

Logistic Regression:
Used for binary classification tasks.
Estimates probabilities using a logistic function.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
Used for both regression and classification tasks.
Non-parametric method based on similarity to neighboring data points.

Support Vector Machine (SVM):
Effective for both regression and classification tasks.
Finds an optimal hyperplane to separate data points.

Data Availability:
All datasets used in the models are provided in CSV format within the "Data" folder of this repository. The usage of relative paths (Data\TitanicData.csv, for example) assumes that the Python files and data are located within the same directory. Adjust paths accordingly if your setup differs.

Implementation Details:
Python Libraries: The implementations make use of the pandas library for data handling, providing easy access and manipulation of the datasets.

Usage: Each Python file corresponds to a specific model and task combination (e.g., regression with Linear Regression and Random Forest, classification with KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Tree).

Notes:
Ensure the correct path to data files if your Python files are not located in the same directory as the "Data" folder.

These implementations serve as foundational examples. Feel free to adapt and extend them for your specific machine learning projects.
